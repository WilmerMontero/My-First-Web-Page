<h2>Introduction.</h2>
<p>My name is Wilmer Montero, I work as an IT technician for the past six years, and this is my first attempt to learn something new. 
    <br>I am a Garifuna as now called the Afro-Caribbean.
     <p style="color:rgb(194, 34, 34)" >To be completely honest I don't like the word "Afro-Caribbean" 
    </p>
    </p>It's not like we carry an "afro" you know!
    The best way to refer to us is by Garifuna people as our 
    <a href="http://garifunaresearch.org/">language name.
    </a>
    <br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garifuna">The Garifuna people</a> originated with the arrival of West African slaves who washed ashore in the Caribbean island of 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Vincent_and_the_Grenadines"> St Vincent.
    </a>
     <p>Garifunas mainly live mostly on coastal towns and villages in the Central American countries of Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. 
     <br>Some Garifunas live alongside the Creole population in main towns.

     <p>Garifuna <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community">communities</a> live mainly on agriculture, fishing, and foreign remittances sent by relatives abroad. 
        <br>Some are also involved in the technical trades. 
        Garifuna who live in the rural areas mainly pursues a subsistence lifestyle, 
        <br>while those in the urban areas live similarly to their Creole neighbors, pursuing professional occupations.
